OpenWeatherMap API

This is a web application that uses openWeather's API. It allows the user to get the current weather conditions of a specified city.
It runs on node and uses express.

Installation:

	Ensure node.js is installed
	Install the required dependencies
	$ npm install express body-parser https ejs


Usage:

	First start the web server
	$ node app.js
	The server is listening on port 3000 unless there is a preconfigured port
	navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to be greeted with index.html
	Enter a two letter country code and the name of city in that country

	For demonstration, the two letter country code of Canada is CA


Ideas for Improvement:

	https://datahub.io/core/country-list#data
	Contains JSON file with all countries and their respective code
	Use this to create a dictionary so that the user can input the country name instead of the code
	
	Exception handling for requests
	
	Make one API call and get current, hourly, weekly forecast and historical weather data
	To do this the longitude and latitude coordinates must be specified
	These are obtained with the API call in app.js
