OpenWeatherMap API

This is a web application that uses openWeather's API. It allows the user to get the current weather conditions of a specified city.
It runs on node and uses express.

Installation:

	Ensure node.js is installed
	Install the required dependencies
	$ npm install express body-parser https ejs


Usage:

	First start the web server
	$ node app.js
	The server is listening on port 3000 unless there is a preconfigured port
	navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to be greeted with index.html
	Enter a two letter country code and the name of city in that country

	For demonstration, the two letter country code of Canada is CA
